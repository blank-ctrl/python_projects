### 
This is the first working version of T.O.A.S.T.
Please note that you may have to install CustomTkinter for it to run.
You should also get familiar with py2app and the code used for this before trying it out yourself since I am uncertain how it will affect other computers. All I can tell is that it works fine on my mac.

Due to uncertainty I have removed the .app file from this repository. If you want to try it for yourself simply copy the code of toast_v2.0.2.py and transform it into a .app application by using py2app.

Afterwards you will have to drag a file called 'store.txt' into the the Resources folder (~/Contents/Resources) for it to work properly.
